    "date": "04-06-2017",
    "venue": "Simons Center for the Arts",
    "description": "Presented by the College of Charleston's department of theatre and dance, Rent is a multiple award-winning musical based loosely on Giacomo Puccini's opera 'La Boheme.' With music, lyrics, and book by Jonathan Larson, this rock musical shares the story of eight impoverished artistic friends struggling to survive bohemian life in Manhattan's East Village in the late 1980s/early 1990s. The group's dreams, losses, and love stories weave through the musical's narration to paint a stunningly raw and emotional portrait of life at the end of the millenium in a gritty world bein torn apart by drugs, HIV/AIDS, social tension and political unrest. Yet, throught all of that darkness, it offers a positive outlook on life and living that resonates with everyone. 'Rent' is the eleventh longest-running Broadway show. Curtain times will be 7:30pm. Performances will take place at the Emmett Robinson Theatre i the Simons Center for the Arts. Admission is $20 for general public, $15 for senior citizens, CofC employees and non-CofC students, $12 for CofC students.",
